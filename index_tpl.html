        <h2>Why it's being sold</h2>
          <p>We've had a lot of fun with the van over the last two years: We repaired many small problems, redid all the upholstery, and installed additional instruments. The van took us successfully to camp spots around California. It wasn't always the fastest vehicle on the road but it did always take us reliably.</p>
          <p>We do however have only one garage parking spot, just started new jobs, and don't have quite the time to have as much fun with the van as we'd like to. For that reason, we're willing to let it go to a new home.</p>
        <h2>Recent work done</h2>
          <p>We've poured a lot of love and thousands of dollars into the van.

        <h2>Problems</h2>
          <ol>  
            <li>
              There is an oil leak in both the engine and transmission. To fix it, one would probably have to rebuild the engine. Since the van has been running just fine even with the oil leak, we haven't done that work yet ‚Äì¬†but over the next few years, the van might sooner or later need an engine rebuild.
            </li>
            <li>
              Getting into the first gear requires a bit of "feel". It's not difficult and will feel fairly normal to anyone used to historic vehicles but we thought we'd call it out anyway.
            </li>
            <li>
              There's a crack in the windshield. It's been there since we've gotten the van and it was never big enough of a problem for us to fix.
            </li>
            <li>
              This is a historic vehicle. Vanagons are insanely popular but we thought we should call out right away that you won't be racing down the highway with 100mph - 55 is where driving feels most comfortable, 70 is doable in the right conditions.
            </li>
